# Matura Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST and EMNIST dataset. 

## Project Structure

ProjectFolder/

├─  main.py 

├─  Models/ (downloaded trained model files go here)

└─  EMNIST Kaggle/ (downloaded dataset files go here)

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.9 or newer.

Required Python packages:
numpy, scipy, pandas, tensorflow, pillow (PIL), opencv-python, tkinter (included by default on Windows), matplotlib (optional for visualization).

Install everything using:

pip install numpy scipy pandas tensorflow pillow opencv-python matplotlib tkinter

## Download Required Files

This project requires external data and model files that are not included in the repository because of file size limitations.

Download the following folders and place them in the same directory as main.py.

- Models
- EMNIST Kaggle
